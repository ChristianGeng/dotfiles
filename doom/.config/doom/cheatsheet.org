* Tips
** Relative Line Numbers
Enable relative line numbers in your config:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)
#+END_SRC

** Evil Collection
Doom uses [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection][evil-collection]] to add Vim keybindings to many modes. If a mode doesn't have the keybindings you expect, check if there's an evil-collection package for it.

** Leader Key
In Doom Emacs, the leader key is SPC (space) by default. This is used as a prefix for many commands.
