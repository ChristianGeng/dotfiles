*** Text Object Modifiers ~i~ and ~a~
In Vim, the ~i~ in commands like ~viw~, ~ciw~, or ~yiw~ is a text object modifier that stands for "inner." The ~a~ stands for "around" (including delimiters/whitespace).

| Modifier | Meaning      | Example Usage | Description                                      |

| a        | around/a     | daw, ca(      | Around the object, includes delimiters/whitespace|

You can use similar patterns with other text objects:
- ~vi"~: Select inside double quotes.
- ~vi(~: Select inside parentheses.
- ~vi[~: Select inside brackets.
- ~viW~: Select word including special characters, selection =excluding= surrounding whitespace
- ~vaW~: Select word including special characters, selection =including= surrounding whitespace

* Tips
** Relative Line Numbers
Enable relative line numbers in your config:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)
#+END_SRC

** Evil Collection
Doom uses [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection][evil-collection]] to add Vim keybindings to many modes. If a mode doesn't have the keybindings you expect, check if there's an evil-collection package for it.

** Leader Key
In Doom Emacs, the leader key is SPC (space) by default. This is used as a prefix for many commands.
